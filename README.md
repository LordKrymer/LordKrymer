# 👋 Hey there! I'm Agustin, also known as Krymer!

🎓 I'm currently studying **Software Engineering** and **Programming**.  
🧑‍💻 Mostly a **backend developer** — but I’m not afraid of jumping into some **basic frontend** when needed.  
🚀 I love building **personal projects** to stay motivated and explore new ideas.

💬 I speak **Spanish** (native) and have a **good command of English** — so feel free to reach out in either!

🛠️ Tech stack I’m most comfortable with:
- **PHP** + **Symfony**
- **Java** + **Spring Boot**
- Practicing with **Node.js** and **Python**
- Big fan of **design patterns**, always looking for ways to implement and learn more about them.

🌱 On the side, I lead a small **integration support team** — which helped me a lot in improving my communication, teamwork, and troubleshooting skills.
